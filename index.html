    <h1>This example is about making lists.</h1>
    <p>
        Here is what I like about lists:
        <ul>
            <li>You can list things.</li>
            <li>And... you can list things.</li>
            <li>Lists are useful.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you make a list, do it like this:
        <ol>
            <li>Do you need the items numbers? Make it an ordered list.</li>
            <li>If you don't need it number, an unordered list works just fine.</li>
            <li>Both types of lists use the li tag for their items
                <ul>
                    <li>Look you can put lists inside your lists, so you can list while you list</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I did it.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
